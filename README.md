Employee Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project involves performing a comprehensive analysis on employee data from ABC Company. The dataset contains 458 rows and 9 columns. We aim to clean, preprocess, analyze, and visualize key insights from the data. The tasks include examining employee distribution, salary expenditures, and relationships between variables such as age and salary.

Objective

The goal of the project is to:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Analyze employee distribution, salary expenditures, age groups, and position-based data.

Visualize the results using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

Tasks Completed

1. Preprocessing

Corrected the "height" column by replacing missing or incorrect values with random values between 150 and 180.

Ensured data consistency and integrity for accurate analysis.


2. Analysis Tasks

Employee Distribution by Team: Analyzed and visualized the distribution of employees across different teams and calculated the percentage split for each team.

Segregation by Position: Grouped employees based on their positions in the company and visualized the distribution.

Predominant Age Group: Identified and visualized the most common age group among employees.

Highest Salary Expenditure: Calculated the team and position with the highest salary expenditure.

Correlation Between Age and Salary: Investigated and visualized the correlation between employee age and salary.


3. Data Visualizations

Bar charts for team and position distributions.

A histogram for age group distribution.

Bar charts for salary expenditure by team and position.

A scatter plot to show the correlation between age and salary.

Installation Instructions

Required Libraries

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For creating static plots.

Seaborn: For advanced data visualizations.


To install these libraries, run:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available as a CSV file. You can download it here.

Make sure the dataset file is placed in the same directory as the project code to avoid file path issues.

How to Run the Code

1. Clone or download the project files.


2. Open the Employee_Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or any Python IDE that supports Jupyter notebooks.


3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load, preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data.


4. Ensure you have the dataset in the same folder as the notebook.

Insights

Based on the analysis, we gained the following insights:

The most predominant age group among employees is between 30-35 years.

The team with the highest salary expenditure is Team X, while Position Y has the highest salary costs.

A positive correlation exists between age and salary, indicating that older employees tend to earn higher salaries.
